Thyra
=====

The project
-----------

Thyra is a secured gate to Massa blockchain and pure decentralization.
Developped by Massa Labs, this application provides a user-friendly way of accessing,
using and building on the blockchain while preventing users from possible attacks or hacks.
Indeed, because Thyra is installed on your own device there is absolutely nothing
and no one between you and the blockchain. Security and decentralization are the app's pillars.

Concretely, Thyra enables every user to have a custom experience with the blockchain.
Once the app is installed, users are be able to activate specific functionalities in a plug-and-play mode
that will provide them what they need. For instance, you will be able to run a distant node in a couple of clicks
or if you prefer you will be able to create and publish a website on the blockchain.
These functionalities are, technically speaking, plugins that can be developed by all developers that wish to.
All details about how you can contribute will be added very soon.
