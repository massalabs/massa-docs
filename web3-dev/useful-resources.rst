================

Here is a list of useful resources for developing decentralized applications:

- `massa-web3 <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3>`_ is a TypeScript library that allow you to interact with the
  Massa blockchain through a local or remote Massa node.
- `create-react-app-massa <https://github.com/massalabs/create-react-app-massa>`_ is a minimal React template made for
  our massa-web3 library.
- `massa-sc-examples <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples>`_ is a collection of smart contracts examples.
- `massa-sc-toolkit <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-toolkit/>`_ is a toolkit meant to facilitate smart contract
  development, testing and deployment.
- `massa-sc-tester <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-tester>`_ is a minimal testing environment made for running
  massa smart contracts locally.

Here is a list of AssemblyScript libraries:

- `massa-standards <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/>`_ Including smart-contract standards for Massa's 
fungible and non-fungible tokens, in addition to standards for common units of measurement on the Massa blockchain (e.g. Massa coin, Gas, Rolls) 
and standards for wallet communication.
- `as-types <https://as-types.docs.massa.net/>`_ AssemblyScript package for general purpose of smart-contract
  development.
- `as-proba <https://as-proba.docs.massa.net/>`_ AssemblyScript package containing mathematic and probabilistic classes
  and functions.
- `massa-as-sdk <https://as-sdk.docs.massa.net/>`_ AssemblyScript package: SDK for interacting with Massa blockchain
  in smart contract.

Here is a list of tools:

- `sc-project-initializer <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@massalabs/sc-project-initializer>`_ initialize a new
  smart-contract project (see :ref:`Getting started <sc-getting-started>`).
- `massa-sc-compiler <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@massalabs/massa-sc-compiler>`_ smart-contract compiler.
- `massa-sc-deployer <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@massalabs/massa-sc-deployer>`_ smart-contract deployer library
- `as-transformer <https://as-transformer.docs.massa.net/>`_ AssemblyScript transformer.
