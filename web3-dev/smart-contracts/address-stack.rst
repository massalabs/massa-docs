Stack system in Massa
=====================

    - ExecuteSC
          When an account A sends an ExecuteSC operation, the stack at the beginning of that execution is: `bottom [ A ]
          top`.
    - CallSC
          When an account A sends a CallSC operation to call a function in a smart contract B, the stack at the
          beginning of the execution of that function is: `bottom [ A, B ] top`. Note: A and B can be the same.
    - Call from one smart contract to another
          When a function F from smart contract C is being executed with the stack [A, B, C] and calls a function on a
          smart contract D, the stack at the beginning of the execution of D's function becomes: `bottom [A, B, C, D]
          top`. When D's function finishes, the stack becomes `bottom [A, B, C] top` and the execution of F resumes.
    - Autonomous SC
          A message sent at a moment when the stack was [A, B, C] and calling a target function F of a smart contract D,
          will yield the following stack at the beginning of the execution of the target function: `bottom [C, D] top`.
          Note: C and D can be the same.
    - Local execution
          Local executions don't change the stack, they allow executing foreign code in the current context.

----

In the `massa assemblyscript sdk <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk/>`_ there is an Object called `Context`. You
can import it in your smart-contract code this way:

.. code-block::

    import { Context } from "@massalabs/massa-as-sdk";

It exposes some useful functions like:

    - `addressStack()` returns the full call stack as a list, bottom to top
    - `caller()` returns the stack element just below the top
    - `callee()` returns the stack element at the top of the stack
    - `transactionCreator()` returns the stack element at the bottom of the stack
