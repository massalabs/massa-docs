Smart-contract Playground
=========================

`Smart-contract Playground <https://massa.net/sc-playground>`_ is a simple interface for writing, unit-testing,
compiling, and sharing the smart-contract code written in Assembly Script. It runs in your browser’s local storage, and
allows you to work on one smart-contract file.

This is the first release of the Playground, and as such it comes with a few limitations. The main ones are that you
can’t deploy or interact with the smart-contract in it yet.

At the moment, Playground is also limited in terms of imported smart-contract methods.

The available methods are:

- `getOf` and `setOf` to to interact with data (read and write)
- `generateEvent` to log blockchain content easily
- `unsafeRandom` to generate a random Number between 0 and the max Safe integer

The available classes are:

- Address

Despite these limitations, you can explore writing, testing and compiling following types of contracts:

- Fungible tokens
- Non-fungible tokens
- Lottery
- Video games
- Price oracles

Here’s an `example of a Fungible token contract and its unit-test

massalabs/massa-sc-playground/main/examples/erc20.ts&ext_unit_test_url=https://
raw.githubusercontent.com/massalabs/massa-sc-playground/main/examples/testERC20.ts>`_
you can explore directly in the Playground’s workspace.

If you need more functionality and methods, or if you wish to request additional features, please submit an issue in
`the Smart-contract Playground Github repository <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-playground>`_. We will do our
best to provide you with everything you need to explore the power and potential of Massa’s smart contracts.
